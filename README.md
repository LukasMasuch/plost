# üçÖ Plost

Demo: [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/tvst/plost)

## Installation

```
pip install plost
```

## Getting started

Docs and tests coming soon! In the meantime, see the [sample app](https://share.streamlit.io/tvst/plost) and its [source code](https://github.com/tvst/plost/blob/master/streamlit_app.py).

## Why the name

Because you've been writing _plots_ wrong all this time.
